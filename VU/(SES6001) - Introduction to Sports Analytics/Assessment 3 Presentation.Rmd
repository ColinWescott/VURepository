# Typical Analysis

GPS tracking is used in the AFL to track player movement during training and matches. This data is typically analysed to provide information about activity and exertion profiles. 

Typical data collected can include velocity, acceleration and distance covered. This data can then be used to calculate time spent and distance travelled at certain speeds.

These metrics can then be used to compare players and positions. They can be used to evaluate fatigue by comparing output across each quarter of a game.

Data can be presented showing summary statistics using means and standard deviations to show where players fall within the data set (Coutts et al., 2010).

# Data Overview

```{r datatibble, include=FALSE}
#Convert data to tibble
GPStibble <- as_tibble(GPSData)
#Show tibble
GPStibble
 
```

--

```{r ref.label="datatibble", echo=FALSE}
```
The data set I am analysing contains GPS data from 5 athletes following 10 stoppages during an AFL game. It provides context to the data through GPS coordinates which show acceleration and velocity. Each player ends their possession with one of 2 types of disposals, a handball or kick.

# What to analyse?

### What information can be derived about what happens when players gain possession from stoppages within an AFL game?

* velocity throughout the possession
* velocity change between quarters
* maximum velocity achieved during possession
* acceleration statistics
  + Mean
  + Max
  + Standard deviation

# Summary

* This data set is small, containing only 10 possessions across 5 players.
* Provided information to answer my question.
 + Players move quite differently depending on what stoppage they gained possession from
 + Possessions can last up to around 20 seconds
 + Depending on players role, their  mean velocity can stay quite high throughout a match
 + The maximum velocity of a player can differ between stoppage type
 + During a possession a player can end up negatively accelerating overall
